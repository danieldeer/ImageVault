# ImageVault

[![Demo](demo.gif)](demo.gif)

ImageVault is a simple server-side application written in PHP that allows users to upload and store images without requiring registration. The application uses unique keys to allow users to access their images. Once an image is uploaded and linked to a specific key, anyone who knows the key can access the images stored under that key.

## Features

- **Simple Upload**: Easily upload images by specifying a key and selecting an image file.
- **Access Control**: Users can access images using the associated key, providing a convenient and secure way to manage image storage.
- **No Registration Required**: No need for users to create an account to upload or access images.
